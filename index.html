        <h2>Var, Let and Const in JavaScript</h2>
            <!-- Var -->
        <p>• Var in javascript are function scoped, which means they are accessible outside the block scope 
            even though we have declared them inside it.</p>
            <!-- Hoisting -->
        <p>• This happends because of Hoisting.</p>
        <p>var are treated as if they are at the top of the function (or global scope) regardless of where 
            the actual declaration occurs, this is called hoisting.</p>
