        <!-- Var, Let and Const in JavaScript -->
        <h2>Var, Let and Const in JavaScript</h2>
            <!-- Var in javascript -->
        <p>• Var in javascript are function scoped, which means they are accessible outside the block scope 
            even though we have declared them inside it.</p>
            <!-- Hoisting -->
        <p>• This happends because of Hoisting.</p>
        <p>var are treated as if they are at the top of the function (or global scope) regardless of where 
            the actual declaration occurs, this is called hoisting.</p>
            <!-- Let in javascript -->
        <p>• Let are declared same as var but it limits the variable scope to the given block. That is why 
            we should declare at the top of the block so that is accessible throughout the block and its 
            sub-blocks.</p>
            <!-- Const in javascript -->
        <p>• Like let const is also block scoped. But it differs from the fact that their variable cannot 
            be redeclared or change by re-assigning the value. The value remains Constant.</p>

        <!-- Transpiler -->
        <h2>Transpiler</h2>
        <p>• If you want old or older versions of browsers to understand new features, one must use a 
            transpiler.</p>
        <p>• A transpiler converts the new JavaScript code to a browser compatible javascript.</p>
        <p>• That is why babel is created.</p>
        <p>• Babel is a JavaScript compiler which converts the new Javascript to a browser compatible 
            Javascript.</p>

        <!-- How to use Babel? -->
        <h2>How to use Babel?</h2>
        <p>• Copy the Babel cdn from babel cdn website and import this in your website.</p>
        <p>• Now after importing the cdn, we need to tell the browser that the current script which we 
            are writing is in Babel.</p>
        <p>• We can do that by setting the type of the script tag.</p>
        <!-- <script type = "text/babel">
            let n = [1, 2, 3];
            let squares = n.map((e) => e * e);
        </script> -->

        <h2>What is the difference between Polyfilling and Transpiling?</h2>
        <p>• A polyfill tries to emulate specific methods, so you cna use them as if they were already 
            supported by the browser (or node engine), on the other hand, A transpiler will modify your 
            code and replace code by other code that does the same, which can then be executed in old 
            browsers.</p>
        <p>• So you can use a polyfill if your target browser did not implement the feature you need 
            to use. A transpiler, on the other hand, is more complex and will let you use the new 
            language syntax and transforming your source code.</p>
