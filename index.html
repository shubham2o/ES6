        <h2>Var, Let and Const in JavaScript</h2>
            <!-- Var in javascript -->
        <p>• Var in javascript are function scoped, which means they are accessible outside the block scope 
            even though we have declared them inside it.</p>
            <!-- Hoisting -->
        <p>• This happends because of Hoisting.</p>
        <p>var are treated as if they are at the top of the function (or global scope) regardless of where 
            the actual declaration occurs, this is called hoisting.</p>
            <!-- Let in javascript -->
        <p>• Let are declared same as var but it limits the variable scope to the given block. That is why 
            we should declare at the top of the block so that is accessible throughout the block and its 
            sub-blocks.</p>
            <!-- Const in javascript -->
        <p>• Like let const is also block scoped. But it differs from the fact that their variable cannot 
            be redeclared or change by re-assigning the value. The value remains Constant.</p>

        <!-- Transpiler -->
        <h2>Transpiler</h2>
        <p>• If you want old or older versions of browsers to understand new features, one must use a 
            transpiler.</p>
        <p>• A transpiler converts the new JavaScript code to a browser compatible javascript.</p>
        <p>• That is why babel is created.</p>
        <p>• Babel is a JavaScript compiler which converts the new Javascript to a browser compatible 
            Javascript.</p>
